## 🔍 Project Overview

The dataset contains transaction-level retail data, including branch, city, and total price. The goal is to:
- Aggregate and analyze sales across branches and cities.
- Identify top-performing locations.
- Visualize results for easier interpretation.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning and manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Development environment


## 📊 Key Features

- Grouped and aggregated sales data by `branch` and `city`
- Visualized total sales using bar charts
- Identified performance differences across locations
- Provided clean and reusable code for further analysis

## 📈 Sample Outputs

- **Bar Chart**: Total sales by branch  
- **Bar Chart**: Total sales by city  

Each visualization helps understand where business is thriving or underperforming.

## 🧠 Insights

- Clear differences in performance between branches and cities
- Opportunity to focus marketing efforts on lower-performing branches
- Visualization can be extended to product-level or time-series analysis

## 🚀 Future Work

- Include time-based trends (monthly/weekly sales)
- Deep dive into product categories or customer segments
- Deploy insights into an interactive dashboard (e.g., using Plotly or Streamlit)
